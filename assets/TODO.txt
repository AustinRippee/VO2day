=======================================================

  Bugs:

=======================================================
- Time prompt isn't being recalled if time is wrongly entered. It goes to convertRace prompt.
- Prompts need to be fixed under the while loops when entering manually.
    - After going through one whole conversion, it goes back to whatever that while loop is
    before. I need to find a way to break out of the while loop if the conversion is successful.
    Otherwise, continue going through the while loop until a successful input has been added.
-------------------------------------------------------
- Fix time format based on the distance that was entered
    - HH:MM:SS.mm is including all leading zeros
-------------------------------------------------------
- Allow for case-insensitive race distances for the input
    - 1600m vs 1600M or 1mi vs 1MI
=======================================================

  Features:

=======================================================
Maybe use Main.Java as a way to input whatever performance from the user and then utilize the
navigation functionality to direct the user to the appropriate function and take that input
-------------------------------------------------------
- Add performances to a database
    - CRUD app functionality for practice either mileagetracker OR simple run CRUD
-------------------------------------------------------
- On file upload, add prompt to user asking:
    - export to CSV with conversions on 4th column
    OR
    - in line for each one (already have this implemented)
-------------------------------------------------------
Add in pace per mile for distances above the mile
-------------------------------------------------------
- Add in more events: 50m, 55m, 60m, 500m, 1200m, 2400m, 4000m, 15000m
- Add hurdles conversions: 60mH, 100mH, 110mH, 180yH, 200yH, 200mH, 300mH, 400mH
- Add in field event conversions from metric to imperial and vice versa
- Add in women's distance conversions
- Finalize 1600m and 3200m conversion
-------------------------------------------------------
- Add more error handling to TrackConvert
